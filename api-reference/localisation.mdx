## Overview

Localization is the REST API developed for translating the contents from English to Indic languages. Using the Localization API, you can either localize a single sentence or multiple sentences in a fraction of time.

## What is Content Localization?

Content Localization is the process of adapting the original content to a new target audience. The localization process requires more effort and skill than translation (e.g., changing measurement systems, adding or changing words to help a local reader). The translated text has to be simple, easy to understand, and capture subtle nuances and cultural references.

The example below demonstrates how the Localization API  will analyze the content's domain & context and localize it:

| Source Content | Translated Content                           |
| -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Book 3 flight tickets to Delhi     | दिल्ली के लिए 3 फ्लाइट टिकट बुक करें                     |
| I have read books written by Abdul Kalam.      | Reported age                          |

In the above statements, the word <b>Book</b> is used in both the sentences; however, our Localization API will localize the word with context to domain/ industry.
